# The Greater Good Pledge (GGP)

[![https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-pledge/assets/images/badge.svg](https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-pledge/assets/images/badge.svg)](https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-pledge)

This is an effort to encourage transparency in open source software.
Projects that take the Greater Good Pledge affirm that there are no
ulterior motives. Specifically:

 - The software that is being provided open source by a company cannot directly or indirectly contribute to making profits for that company.
 - The majority of contributors represent dispersed community (and not required participants for a company)
 - The community must have completely open communication, meaning all discussion around development is public.
 - All software is provided under an open source license, with no private distributions or versions with special privileges.

By taking the [Greater Good Pledge](https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-pledge/), a community affirms that it provides software under a traditional
open source model, and exists non-selfishly to solve problems for users and
not make profits off of them.
