## What is it?

The [Greater Good Affirmation](https://www.github.com/good-labs/greater-good-affirmation) is an affirmation
for a community with one or more open source projects to take to assert that the project
has no ulterior motives. The affirmation asks an individual or community
to assert that the project exists for the greater good.

<br>

## Why do we need it?

The definition of open source broadly describes the availability of code:

> denoting software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.

However, it has also come to describe a culture. Stamping a piece of software with
the label "open source" says many good things. Along with helping with development
by way of "with many eyes, all bugs are shallow," it says that the community values
transparency. The powerful term has become so embedded with these values that any
organization that ascribes to be "open source" by default inherits them.

### We need transparency of incentives

This inheritance has become problematic only in the case that the values and incentives expected
are not in line with those that are actual. It cannot be clear, for example,
if open source software is provided for the greater good, or if the software
has an ulterior motive, such as to encourage users to ultimately use a paid service.

How might this happen? Let's imagine a user or developer that sees a lot of buzz
on social media, and finds a piece of open source software provided by a corporate entity.
In the case of a developer, he or she might look at issues and be excited to participate.
In the case of a user, he or she might try using the software locally. In both cases,
the user and developer are invested. They put time and resources into testing and developing
with the software. The hum of social media tells them it's the right thing to do - if they 
do not, they will fall behind.

Time passes, and both are invested. Perhaps they've created something to deploy, and have
realized that despite being open source, the technology is unrealistically complicated for a team to set up and manage in house. 
It could also be that the resources required for optimal performance are not available to them.
Given the initial investment, the team now has incentive to pay for the service, or lose the time
already invested. This is the point where it's questionable if the software is truly provided for
the greater good, or has an underlying incentive to make monetary gains. The user and developer
in the story here had no signal or flag to become aware of these issues when they discovered
the software, because it was open source, and that only means good things. This
is not transparent communication of incentives, and it's manipulative. 

<br>

### We need to have awareness for how communities come to be

Traditionally, open source software is identified and advertised via
popularity that comes from usage, number of developers, and media attention.
A project would not surface if it was not truly used and valued by disparate contributors. 
We can call this the heartbeat of open source. In modern day, this heartbeat can
be artifically created by way of monetary resources, advertising, and creation
of conferences and other developer interactions.

How then can it be possible to distinguish between a traditional open
source community that grew by way of the value of the software versus one artificially
seeded? The answer is that you largely cannot. This is a compelling reason for the
Greater Good Affirmation. While it's not impossible that an industry entity would contribute
to open source without some underlying financial incentive, this usually isn't the case.
By taking the Greater Good Affirmation, a community can assert that there are no
underlying or hidden incentives. The software is provided for the greater good.

### We need to ensure that open source isn't hijacked for branding

Without an assertion of being for the greater good, it can be argued that
application of the "open source" label is a branding strategy.
People feel good about contributing to, and using software, that is stamped with
open source. People want to participate in open source communities because it reflects
well on them. It's okay to contribute to any kind of community or project,
but if you are a contributor, you need to have a transparent understanding 
of the project. If you choose to contribute by way of falling in love with
the open source label, the larger purpose of the project (that might not be provided
transparently) needs to be explicit.

## What is the affirmation?

The affirmation exists to distinguish between open source software that exists non-selfishly.
Taking the affirmation comes down to doing a pull request to the affirmation repository
to add information about a community.
