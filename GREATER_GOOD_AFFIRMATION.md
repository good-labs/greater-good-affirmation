# The Greater Good Affirmation, Version 1.0.x

As a representative of an open source project or group, I affirm that the community to which I belong makes a best effort to exist *for the greater good.* Specifically, this means that:

 - The project or group that I represent has honorable intentions, meaning doing something that is primarily intended to benefit many people, or a community over any financial interest.
 - The project grew to be valued for its own utility without influence of artificial means, or unfair advantage.
 - The project or group strives to do no harm.

I make this affirmation in good faith, and am free to withdraw my participation at any time.
