# The Greater Good Affirmation, Version 1.0.x

As a representative of an open source project or group, I affirm that the community to which I belong makes a best effort to exist *for the greater good.* Specifically, this means that:

 - The project or group that I represent is oriented toward sustainably helping people or advancing science rather than maximizing profits.
 - Marketing is done by the community rather than a corporate sponsor.
 - We have a code of conduct and will enforce it.
 
I make this affirmation in good faith, and am free to withdraw my participation at any time.
